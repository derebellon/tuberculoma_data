## Abstract
The abstract of the systematic review is as follows:

This systematic review and descriptive analysis examines the diagnostic and management complexities of cerebral tuberculomas in pregnant women, a condition infrequent and characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms resembling those of other neurological diseases. We analyzed data from 26 cases across 16 countries, highlighting the clinical manifestations, diagnostic strategies—including diverse interpretations of histopathological, imaging, and laboratory findings—and treatment options for tuberculomas during pregnancy. The absence of comprehensive guidelines for managing this condition underscores the urgent need for specialized knowledge and research in this area, aiming to improve outcomes for both pregnant women and their products of gestation.
